# arista-ceoslab-operator
The Arista Networks cEOS-lab operator manages containerized EOS instances in k8s clusters managed
by KNE. It is based on operator-sdk.

## Usage
Deploy the kustomized k8s config:
```
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/aristanetworks/arista-ceoslab-operator/config/default
```
This will pull any necessary images.

## Getting Started
You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster
